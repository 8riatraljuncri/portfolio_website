In this section, we will explore some of the features and functions of Predator VST. Predator VST has a user-friendly interface that allows you to easily tweak and customize your sounds. You can also use the preset browser to find and load the sounds you need. Predator VST has three main sections: the synthesizer, the effects and the arpeggiator/sequencer.
 
## The Synthesizer
 
The synthesizer section of Predator VST consists of three oscillators, two filters, four envelopes, four LFOs and a modulation matrix. You can use these components to create a variety of sounds, from basses and leads to pads and plucks. Here are some of the features of the synthesizer section:

- The oscillators can generate different waveforms, such as saw, square, pulse, triangle, sine and noise. You can also use samples or wavetables as oscillator sources.
- The filters can shape the sound by removing or boosting certain frequencies. You can choose from different filter types, such as low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch and comb. You can also use the filter envelope to modulate the filter cutoff and resonance.
- The envelopes can control the volume, pitch and filter of the sound over time. You can adjust the attack, decay, sustain and release parameters of each envelope. You can also use the envelope velocity to modulate the envelope amount.
- The LFOs can add movement and variation to the sound by modulating different parameters. You can choose from different waveforms, such as sine, triangle, saw, square and random. You can also sync the LFO rate to the tempo of your project.
- The modulation matrix can assign any source to any destination in Predator VST. You can use sources such as envelopes, LFOs, velocity, aftertouch and MIDI controllers. You can use destinations such as oscillator pitch, filter cutoff, volume and pan.

## The Effects
 
The effects section of Predator VST consists of four slots that can host different effects modules. You can use these effects to enhance and modify your sounds. Here are some of the effects modules available in Predator VST:

- Distortion: adds distortion and saturation to the sound.
- Bitcrusher: reduces the bit depth and sample rate of the sound.
- Chorus: adds a chorus effect to the sound.
- Flanger: adds a flanger effect to the sound.
- Phaser: adds a phaser effect to the sound.
- Delay: adds a delay effect to the sound.
- Reverb: adds a reverb effect to the sound.
- Compressor: compresses the dynamic range of the sound.
- Limiter: limits the output level of the sound.
- Equalizer: adjusts the frequency balance of the sound.

## The Arpeggiator/Sequencer
 
The arpeggiator/sequencer section of Predator VST allows you to create rhythmic and melodic patterns with your sounds. You can use this section to add groove and movement to your music. Here are some of the features of the arpeggiator/sequencer section:

- The arpeggiator mode can generate arpeggios based on the notes you play on your keyboard. You can adjust the speed, direction, octave range and note order of the arpeggios.
- The sequencer mode can record and play back up to 16 steps of notes and velocities. You can edit each step individually or use randomize and mutate functions to create variations.
- The swing function can add a swing feel to your patterns by shifting every other step slightly off-grid.
- The free mode can let you play your patterns without syncing them to your host tempo.
